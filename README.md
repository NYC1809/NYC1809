# H'ello 👋

I am NYC_1809 and I am not really good at coding. I have some nice projects planned, which I will work at in the future.
My main topic will be about minecraft and everything around it.

Some time ago I wrote Minecraft Plugins for the organisation [SkyCave.de](https://github.com/skycavemc).

### - 🦄 Currently working on:
  - 🏹 Hypixel API requests
  - 🔥 My Own Minecraft Hypixel Skyblock Mod

### - 👻 Planned for the future:
  - ✨ Hypixel bot controlled by the official Hypixel API
  - 🐬 Anti Cheat API for public use
  
  
  
### - 😈 Minecraft Anti Cheat: 
  - 🖤 Anti Cheat - controlled by an neuronal network
  - 🦔 Anti Cheat - network to test my anti cheat (public usable)
